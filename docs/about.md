# About Me
I'm a system administrator in Iowa. Currently working on a number of Microsoft and Linux based technologies. I also do a bit with home automation.

This blog is purely something I do for my own amusement so I don't always post regularly.

There was a previous version of this blog, which I have archived [here](https://github.com/tupcakes/old.practicalkungfu.net/tree/gh-pages). I thought about trying to migrate the content, but but decided against it. I'll keep the repo in an archived state for posterity.
